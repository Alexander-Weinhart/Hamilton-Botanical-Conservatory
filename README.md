# Hamilton Botanical Conservatory
A fictional nonprofit organization that strives to improve the environment using horticulture. This features full responsiveness and quality control perfection. There are a lot of details that go into a 14 page site, it took me a month and a half start-to-finish. Photos were captured with express permission from Cincinnati's Krohn Conservatory. This is my crowning HTML/CSS/JavaScript achievement to date, created for a college class. It recieved the full 200/200 points as a grade, and my professor now uses it as a positive example for his newer web design students, saying "You don't have to go to this great length to get the 100%, but this is work from one of my best students."
